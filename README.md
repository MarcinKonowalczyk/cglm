### üìö Documentation

All functions and their parameters are documented above their declaration inside their corresponding headers. <br />
Alternatively, you can read the complete documentation [here](http://cglm.readthedocs.io).

### üî® Building

cglm can be used in it's entirety as a header-only library simply by including `cglm/cglm.h`. If you wish to link against it instead, it can be built using one of the supported build systems. Detailed information about building on individual platforms and build systems along with the instructions for building the documentation can be found in [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md).

### ‚úÖ Usage

#### Header-only

Include the `cglm/cglm.h` header and use functions with the `glm_` prefix.
```c
#include "cglm/cglm.h"

// ...

vec2 vector;
glm_vec2_zero(vector);
```

#### Struct API

Include `cglm/struct.h` and use `glms_`.
```c
#include "cglm/struct.h"

// ...

vec2s vector = glms_vec2_zero();
```

#### Linked

Include `cglm/call.h` and use `glmc_`.
```c
#include "cglm/call.h"

// ...

vec2 vector;
glmc_vec2_zero(vector);
```

### üìå Migration notes:

- `_dup` (duplicate) functions were renamed to `_copy`. For instance: `glm_vec_dup` -> `glm_vec3_copy`.
- OpenGL related functions were dropped to make cglm API independent.
- **[bugfix]** Euler angles had been previously implemented in reverse order (extrinsic). This was fixed to be intrinsic.
- **[major change]** Starting with **v0.4.0**, quaternions are stored as [x, y, z, w]. Previously it was [w, x, y, z].
- **[api rename]** Starting with **v0.4.5**, `glm_simd_` functions are renamed to `glmm_`.
- **[new option]** Starting with **v0.4.5**, alignment requirements can be disabled. Read more in the documentation.  
- **[major change]** Starting with **v0.5.0**, vec3 functions occupy the **glm_vec3_** namespace. This used to be **glm_vec_** in earlier versions.
- **[major change]** Starting with **v0.5.1**, `vec3` and `mat3` types are not aligned by default.
- **[major change]** Starting with **v0.7.3**, inline print functions are disabled by default in release mode to eliminate printing costs (see the Options chapter of the docs). <br> Colored output can be disabled (see documentation).
- **[major change]** Starting with **v0.8.3**, alternate clipspace configurations are supported. The `CGLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE` and `CGLM_FORCE_LEFT_HANDED` flags are provided to control clip depth and handedness. This makes it easier to incorporate cglm into projects using graphics APIs such as Vulkan or Metal. See https://cglm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/opt.html#clipspace-option-s

cglm contains general purpose mat4 product and inverse functions but also provides optimized versions for affine transformations. If you want to multiply two affine transformation matrices you can use glm_mul instead of glm_mat4_mul and glm_inv_tr (ROT + TR) instead glm_mat4_inv.
```C
/* multiplication */
mat4 modelMat;
glm_mul(T, R, modelMat);

/* othonormal rot + tr matrix inverse (rigid-body) */
glm_inv_tr(modelMat);
```

### Struct API

The struct API works as follows (note the `s` suffix on types, `glms_` prefix on functions and `GLMS_` on constants):

```C
#include <cglm/struct.h>

mat4s mat = GLMS_MAT4_IDENTITY_INIT;
mat4s inv = glms_mat4_inv(mat);
```

Struct functions generally take parameters *by copy* and *return* the results rather than taking pointers and writing to out parameters. That means your variables can usually be `const`, if you're into that.

The types used are actually unions that allow access to the same data in multiple ways. One of these involves anonymous structures available since C11. MSVC supports them in earlier versions out of the box and GCC/Clang as well if you enable `-fms-extensions`.
To explicitly enable anonymous structures #define `CGLM_USE_ANONYMOUS_STRUCT` as `1` or as `0` to disable them.
For backwards compatibility, you can also `#define CGLM_NO_ANONYMOUS_STRUCT` to disable them. If you don't specify explicitly, cglm will attempt a best guess based on your compiler and C version.
